cURL is a client-side software for transferring data using URLs. This is the
Certificate Authorities (CA) certificate bundle for peer SSL certificate
verification. For more information see:

https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html

This package contains the original CA certificate bundle file and the custom
C library source code for querying its path all packaged for the build2 package
manager (bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the certificate
bundle itself to the cURL mailing lists. Send the library, build system and
packaging-related feedback to the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see
https://lists.build2.org for posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of libca-certificates-curl for build2 is tracked in a Git
repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/curl/
